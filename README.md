1. Generate a random number within a specified range, such as 1 to 100.

2. Prompt the user to enter their guess for the generated number.

3. Compare the user's guess with the generated number and provide feedback on whether the guess
is correct, too high, or too low.

4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until the user guesses the correct number.

You can incorporate additional details as follows:

5. Limit the number of attempts the user has to guess the number.
 
6. Add the option for multiple rounds, allowing the user to play again.
  
7. Display the user's score, which can be based on the number of attempts taken or rounds won.


 explanation:

Random class is used to generate a random number between 1 and 100.

Scanner class is used to take the user’s input.

Loops (while and do-while) are used to control attempts and allow replay.

If–else statements are used to check whether the guess is too high or too low.

Variables are used to store the number, attempts, score, and user choice.
